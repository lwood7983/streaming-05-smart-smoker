##Assignment - Creating a Producer

Streaming data may come from web analytics, social media, smart devices, and more. In these next two modules, we'll look at implementing analytics for a "smart smoker" (as in slow cooked food). 

In Module 5, we'll understand the process, design our system, and implement the producer. In Module 6, we'll add the consumers, implementing analytics based on a rolling window of time, and raise an alert when interesting events are detected. 

Please read and follow the guidelines below. You may work on your own - or with others in the class as you like. Use the discussion forum to work together and share suggestions and questions. 

 

The Problem / Challenge To Solve
Please read about the Smart Smoker system here: Smart Smoker
Access the smoker data file here Download smoker data file here.
We want to stream information from a smart smoker. Read one value every half minute. (sleep_secs = 30)

smoker-temps.csv has 4 columns:

[0] Time = Date-time stamp for the sensor reading
[1] Channel1 = Smoker Temp --> send to message queue "01-smoker"
[2] Channe2 = Food A Temp --> send to message queue "02-food-A"
[3] Channe3 = Food B Temp --> send to message queue "02-food-B"
Requirements

General Design Questions

How many producers processes do you need to read the temperatures:
How many queues do we use: 
How many listening callback functions do we need (Hint: one per queue): 
If that is all you need to get started, you can begin the project now. Apply everything you've learned previously.
